# Transformer Progress Measures Reproduction

This directory contains a focused transformer setup for reproducing progress-measure style results from mechanistic interpretability work.

The main intent is not just to observe grokking behavior, but to analyze internal representations (for example Fourier structure and periodic activation patterns) during and after training.
